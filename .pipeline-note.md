# Pipeline Configuration Note

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Testing Only - No Infrastructure Creation

This Jenkins pipeline is configured for **TESTING AND VALIDATION ONLY**.

### What the Pipeline Does:
✅ Installs Terraform, Checkov, and TFLint  
✅ Builds Lambda package (for validation)  
✅ Runs `terraform fmt` to check formatting  
✅ Runs TFLint on modules and projects  
✅ Runs Checkov security scans on modules and projects  
✅ Runs `terraform init` and `terraform validate`  
✅ Creates a Terraform plan (for validation)  
✅ Runs Checkov on the Terraform plan  

### What the Pipeline Does NOT Do:
❌ **Does NOT run `terraform apply`**  
❌ **Does NOT create any AWS infrastructure**  
❌ **Does NOT modify any AWS resources**  

### To Actually Deploy Infrastructure:

If you want to deploy infrastructure, you need to:

1. **Manually run Terraform commands:**
   ```bash
   cd projects/dev  # or staging, or prod
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply  # Only run this when you're ready to create resources
   ```

2. **Or enable the Apply stage in Jenkinsfile:**
   - Remove the `when { expression { return false } }` condition
   - Uncomment/restore the Terraform Apply stage

### Safety Features:
- Terraform Apply stage is disabled by default
- All validation and scanning stages run safely
- Plan files are created but never applied automatically
